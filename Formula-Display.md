# Formula Display

> **Formula Display Guidelines for the Physics Learning Ecosystem**

This document defines the standard approach for displaying mathematical and physics formulas within the Physics Learning ecosystem.

Its purpose is to ensure consistency, readability, and educational clarity across all repositories.

This document defines presentation principles rather than implementation details.

---

# Purpose

Mathematical formulas are a core part of physics education.

Consistent formula presentation improves:

* Learning experience
* Readability
* Visual consistency
* Accessibility
* AI-assisted development

Every repository displaying mathematical expressions should follow these guidelines.

---

# Design Principles

Formula presentation should follow these principles:

* Prioritize educational clarity.
* Maintain mathematical correctness.
* Present formulas consistently.
* Separate formula rendering from business logic.
* Keep presentation independent of implementation technology.

The representation of knowledge is more important than the rendering technology.

---

# Rendering Responsibilities

Formula rendering is responsible for:

* Displaying mathematical expressions.
* Displaying physics equations.
* Displaying variables and symbols.
* Displaying units when appropriate.

Formula rendering should **not** contain:

* Physics calculations.
* Educational logic.
* Application workflows.
* Rendering decisions unrelated to formulas.

---

# Consistency

The same mathematical concept should always be presented consistently across repositories.

For example:

* Use identical notation for common physics variables.
* Maintain consistent equation formatting.
* Use consistent mathematical symbols.

Avoid presenting the same concept in multiple visual styles without educational justification.

---

# Variable Representation

Variables should follow internationally recognized scientific notation whenever practical.

Examples include:

* *F* — Force
* *m* — Mass
* *a* — Acceleration
* *v* — Velocity
* *t* — Time

Avoid inventing repository-specific symbols for well-established concepts.

---

# Units

Units should be displayed using standard SI notation whenever applicable.

Examples include:

* m
* s
* kg
* N
* J

Units should remain visually distinguishable from variables.

---

# Inline and Block Formulas

Use inline formulas for short expressions that appear naturally within text.

Use block formulas for:

* Important equations
* Multi-step derivations
* Complex mathematical expressions

Consistent formatting improves readability.

---

# Educational Clarity

Formula presentation should support learning rather than decoration.

Recommended practices:

* Display formulas clearly.
* Avoid unnecessary visual complexity.
* Keep spacing readable.
* Preserve mathematical structure.

Presentation should make formulas easier—not harder—to understand.

---

# Reusable Formula Components

Frequently used formulas or rendering helpers should be implemented as reusable components whenever practical.

Examples include:

* Fraction formatting
* Superscripts
* Subscripts
* Equation blocks
* Unit formatting

Avoid duplicating formula presentation logic across repositories.

---

# Separation of Concerns

Formula rendering should only present mathematical information.

The following separation should always be maintained:

```text id="hmv4ae"
Physics Domain
        │
        ▼
Application Services
        │
        ▼
Formula Adapter
        │
        ▼
Formula Renderer
```

The Physics Domain defines the equation.

The Formula Adapter is responsible for presenting it.

---

# Accessibility Considerations

Formula presentation should remain understandable for all learners whenever practical.

Recommended practices include:

* Maintain sufficient visual contrast.
* Preserve readable font sizes.
* Avoid relying solely on color to communicate meaning.
* Keep mathematical notation visually consistent.

Accessibility should improve understanding without changing mathematical meaning.

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

This document complements:

* **Architecture.md**
* **Coding-Standards.md**
* **Canvas-Guidelines.md**
* **UI-Guidelines.md**
* **Accessibility.md**

Together, these standards ensure consistent presentation of mathematical content throughout the Physics Learning ecosystem.

---

# Summary

Mathematical formulas represent the core knowledge of physics education.

Repositories should present formulas consistently, accurately, and clearly while keeping rendering independent from educational logic and implementation technology.

Formula presentation should always enhance understanding and remain faithful to established scientific notation.
