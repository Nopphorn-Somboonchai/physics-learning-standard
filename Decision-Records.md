# Decision Records

> **Architectural Decision Records for the Physics Learning Ecosystem**

This document defines how significant architectural and engineering decisions should be documented within the Physics Learning ecosystem.

Its purpose is to preserve the reasoning behind important decisions so that future contributors can understand not only *what* was decided, but also *why*.

This document defines a lightweight decision-recording process rather than a formal governance procedure.

---

# Purpose

Every software project evolves over time.

As the project grows, architectural decisions become increasingly difficult to reconstruct from code alone.

Decision Records preserve the context, reasoning, and expected impact of important decisions, helping maintain consistency across repositories and reducing repeated discussions.

---

# When to Create a Decision Record

A Decision Record should be created whenever a significant architectural or engineering decision is made.

Examples include:

* Introducing a new architectural pattern.
* Changing repository organization.
* Adopting or replacing major technologies.
* Defining new engineering standards.
* Making decisions that affect multiple repositories.

Routine implementation changes do not require Decision Records.

# Decision Template

Each Decision Record should follow a simple and consistent structure.

```md
# Decision

## Title

A short, descriptive title.

---

## Context

What problem or situation required a decision?

---

## Decision

What was decided?

---

## Rationale

Why was this decision made?

---

## Impact

How does this affect the project?

---

## Related Standards

List any affected standard documents.
```

The template should remain concise while providing enough context for future contributors.

---

# Decision Principles

Decision Records should follow these principles:

* Record significant decisions only.
* Explain the reasoning behind every decision.
* Keep records concise and easy to understand.
* Preserve historical context.
* Prefer long-term maintainability over short-term convenience.

A Decision Record should communicate intent, not implementation details.

---

# Decision Lifecycle

Architectural decisions evolve over time.

A Decision Record typically progresses through the following stages:

```text
Proposed
    │
    ▼
Accepted
    │
    ▼
Implemented
    │
    ▼
Superseded
    │
    ▼
Archived
```

Historical decisions should remain available even after they are superseded.

Understanding previous decisions helps prevent repeating past mistakes.

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

Decision Records complement all engineering standards within the Physics Learning ecosystem.

When a standard changes, the corresponding Decision Record should explain:

* Why the change was necessary.
* Which standards were affected.
* The expected long-term impact.

Decision Records provide historical context for the evolution of the project's standards.

---

# Golden Rule

> **Decisions should explain why, not only what.**
>
> Future contributors should understand the reasoning without needing to reconstruct it from code or documentation.

---

# Summary

Decision Records preserve the knowledge behind important architectural and engineering decisions.

By documenting context, rationale, and impact, the Physics Learning ecosystem remains easier to maintain, easier to evolve, and more consistent across repositories.

Good software evolves.

Good Decision Records explain how—and why—it evolved.
