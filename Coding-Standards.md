# Coding Standards

> **Coding Standards for the Physics Learning Ecosystem**

This document defines the coding standards adopted by repositories within the Physics Learning ecosystem.

Its purpose is to promote consistency, readability, maintainability, and long-term sustainability across all projects.

These standards focus on **how code should be written**, independent of frameworks, libraries, or development tools.

---

# Purpose

Every repository should follow a consistent coding style.

Consistent code improves:

* Readability
* Maintainability
* Collaboration
* Code review
* AI-assisted development

This document defines coding principles that remain stable even as technologies evolve.

---

# General Principles

The following principles apply to all production code.

## Readability First

Code should be written for humans first.

Clear and understandable code is preferred over clever or overly compact implementations.

---

## Simplicity

Choose the simplest solution that satisfies the requirements.

Avoid unnecessary abstraction or complexity.

---

## Single Responsibility

Each module, class, and function should have one clear responsibility.

---

## Reusability

Extract reusable logic into shared modules when appropriate.

Avoid unnecessary duplication.

---

## Consistency

Follow established project conventions consistently.

Consistency is more valuable than personal preference.

---

# JavaScript Standard

Repositories should adopt modern JavaScript.

Recommended practices include:

* ECMAScript 2025 (or newer)
* ES Modules (`import` / `export`)
* `const` by default
* `let` when reassignment is required
* Avoid `var`
* Prefer modern language features over legacy patterns

Code should remain compatible with the project's supported runtime environment.

---

# Module Organization

Modules should be:

* Small
* Focused
* Independent
* Easy to test

Each module should expose a clear public interface.

Avoid circular dependencies whenever possible.

Group related functionality together.

---

# Functions

Functions should:

* Perform one task.
* Have descriptive names.
* Be predictable.
* Return consistent results.
* Avoid hidden side effects whenever practical.

Prefer small functions over large, multi-purpose implementations.

---

# Error Handling

Errors should be handled intentionally.

Recommended practices:

* Detect errors early.
* Provide meaningful error messages.
* Avoid silently ignoring failures.
* Handle expected failures gracefully.
* Allow unexpected failures to surface during development.

Error handling should improve reliability without hiding problems.

---

# Asynchronous Code

Prefer modern asynchronous patterns.

Recommended practices:

* Use `async` / `await`.
* Handle rejected promises.
* Avoid deeply nested asynchronous code.
* Keep asynchronous workflows easy to follow.

Asynchronous code should remain readable and predictable.

---

# Imports & Exports

Use ES Module syntax consistently.

Recommended practices:

* Prefer named exports.
* Import only what is required.
* Group related imports together.
* Keep module dependencies explicit.

Avoid unnecessary wildcard imports.

---

# Comments & Documentation

Comments should explain **why**, not **what**.

Well-written code should be largely self-explanatory.

Use comments to describe:

* Design decisions
* Non-obvious behavior
* Important assumptions
* External constraints

Keep comments accurate as the code evolves.

---

# Immutability

Prefer immutable data whenever practical.

Avoid modifying objects received from other modules.

Instead, create new objects when state changes are required.

Immutable code is easier to understand, test, and debug.

---

# Configuration

Avoid hard-coded configuration values throughout the application.

Store configurable values in dedicated configuration modules whenever appropriate.

Examples include:

- Physics constants
- Application settings
- Rendering options
- Feature flags

Centralizing configuration improves maintainability and simplifies future changes.

---

# Logging

Logging should support debugging and operational monitoring without becoming part of the application's core logic.

Recommended practices:

- Use logging intentionally.
- Avoid leaving temporary debugging statements in production code.
- Keep log messages clear and meaningful.
- Prefer centralized logging strategies when logging becomes part of the application.

Logging should help diagnose problems without reducing code readability.

---

# Code Quality

High-quality code should be:

* Readable
* Consistent
* Modular
* Predictable
* Maintainable

Avoid:

* Duplicate logic
* Dead code
* Excessive nesting
* Unnecessary complexity
* Hidden dependencies

Regular refactoring is encouraged when it improves clarity without changing behavior.

---

# Testing Expectations

Production code should be designed to be testable.

Testing should focus on:

* Core business logic
* Physics calculations
* Edge cases
* Reusable modules
* Expected and unexpected inputs

Tests should improve confidence without becoming unnecessarily complex.

---

# Relationship to Other Standards

This document complements the following standards:

* **Principles.md** — Engineering philosophy
* **Architecture.md** — System architecture
* **Folder-Structure.md** — Repository organization
* **Naming-Conventions.md** — Naming rules
* **Canvas-Guidelines.md** — Canvas implementation
* **UI-Guidelines.md** — User interface standards
* **Formula-Display.md** — Formula rendering
* **Accessibility.md** — Accessibility requirements

Together, these standards establish a consistent engineering approach across the Physics Learning ecosystem.

---

# Summary

Consistent coding standards improve collaboration, reduce maintenance costs, and make software easier to understand for both developers and AI agents.

Repositories should prioritize readable, maintainable, and predictable code over personal preferences or short-term convenience.

As technologies evolve, these principles should remain stable and continue guiding the development of high-quality educational software.
